In this I have created three different minor projects.<br />
First one is the comparision of Logistic Regression and KNN on MNIST dataset in which I have compare KNN and Logistic Regression on MNIST dataset and among which KNN prove better as compare to Logistic.<br />
Second one is KMeans Clustering from scratch in which I have created KMeans Clustering algorithm for 1 dimensional dataset from scratch.<br />
And third one is spam email detection. In this I have created a program for spam email detection using naive bayes algorithm.
